## Description

The Steel Structure Analysis Software is a web-based application that allows engineers and designers to create and analyze steel structures. The software will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, designing, and analyzing steel structures.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the system. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the application.
- Dashboard: The dashboard displays an overview of the user's projects and recent activity.
- Project Creation: Users can create new projects and specify the project name, description, and other details.
- Design Interface: The design interface allows users to create and modify steel structures using a visual interface. Users can select the type of steel structure, specify the dimensions and other design details, and generate a 3D model of the structure.
- Analysis: The software will provide an analysis feature that will allow users to perform various analysis on the created steel structure, such as load analysis, structural analysis, and stability analysis.
- Reports: The software will provide a report generation feature that will allow users to generate detailed reports on the steel structure's analysis results.

## Innovative Idea

Our innovative idea is to implement a real-time collaborative design feature for Osdag on the cloud, which would provide users with a more efficient and collaborative design process.
