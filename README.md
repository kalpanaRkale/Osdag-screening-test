**Description: The software is a web-based application that allows engineers and designers to create and analyze steel structures. The software will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, designing, and analyzing steel structures.
**

**Features:
**
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in and log out of the system. This feature will ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
Dashboard: The dashboard will display an overview of the user's projects and recent activity.
Project Creation: Users can create new projects and specify the project name, description, and other details.
Design Interface: The design interface will allow users to create and modify steel structures using a visual interface. Users can select the type of steel structure, specify the dimensions and other design details, and generate a 3D model of the structure.
Analysis: The software will provide an analysis feature that will allow users to perform various analysis on the created steel structure, such as load analysis, structural analysis, and stability analysis.
Reports: The software will provide a report generation feature that will allow users to generate detailed reports on the steel structure's analysis results.


**Innovative idea :
**
A real-time collaborative design feature for Osdag on the cloud which would provide users with a more efficient and collaborative design process.

Implementing a this collaborative design feature in Osdag would involve creating a drawing board using HTML5 Canvas, using WebSockets for real-time communication, implementing Operational Transformation for collaborative editing, adding user authentication and authorization, and designing a user interface with features like chat or video conferencing to facilitate collaboration.


**Technology Stack:

Backend: Django REST Framework
Frontend: React JS
Database: MySQL**


The software will be a useful tool for engineers and designers who want to create and analyze steel structures. By using Django REST Framework and React JS, you can build a robust and scalable web application that provides a user-friendly interface for designing and analyzing steel structures.
